# Project-Summary

### 1. Analyzation of the livability of Melbourne
- Description: This project develops a Cloud-based solution that exploits a multitude of VMs for harvesting tweets from Australia and compare/use alongside/augment data on AURIN to analysis and compare the livability of Melbourne with other Australian countries. As the result, we build a pipeline to crawl data from Twitter APIs, build a multi-nodes CouchDB database, analysis data by MapReduce and develop a frontend to display the analysis result in multi-senarios. Deployment is achieved by Ansible and the request is called by FastAPI.
- Duration: 2022/03 - 2022/06

### 2. Self-Regulation Learning (SRL) Evaluation and Improvement
- Description: This project aims at improving students' SRL level in order to closing gap between academia and industry through personalized student journey map. Eventually, we 
  - justify the validity of marking function, which is the criteria to measure students' SRL level by their online study behaviours
  - construct a model to predict students' SRL levle by their study behaviours in order to tell students' weakness and strength thus making progress (with accuracy about 90%)
  - develop a model training pipeline for further training and a dashboard for data as well as model analysis and predictions
  - develop a learning analytic tool to enhace students' outcomes and target mechanisms by which students are able to monitor their skill development at entire course structures
- Duration: 2022/03 - 2022/11

### 3. Algorithm developoment for Stereo Matching
- Description: This project is to develop an algorithm for Stereo Matching and calculate depth of objects from stereo. Eventually, we
  - achieve SSD, ZSSD, and ZNCC stereo matching algorithms
  - optimize algorithm by the chosen of window size, adding weight on matching window, sub-pixel precision improvement and adding smooth constraint
  - accelerate the algorithm exponentially by using numpy matrix calculation
  - Accuracy: Root Mean Error under 10
 - Duration: 2022/08 - 2022/11

### 4. Research on Stream Data Management System
- Description: This projects researches on technology development in the field on Stream Data Management System. We investigate and compare the key techiniques of Storm, Millwheel, Flink, Google Cloud dataflow and BEAM.
- Duration: 2022/03 - 2022/06
